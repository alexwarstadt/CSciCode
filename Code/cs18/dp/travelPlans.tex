\textbf{Recurrence relation for Travel Plans}\\
Let TP(i, t, d) give the minimum cost from index $i$ for a journey of length $t$ and a maximum daily travel distance $d$. TP should also have access to an array of hotels $C$ which starts and ends with values 0 and has a length of $t+1$.

\[ TP(i, t, d) = \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{l l}
    C(i) & \quad \text{if $t \le d$}\\
    C(i) + min(TP(i+1, t-1, d), \\
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;TP(i+2, t-3, d), \dots,\\
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;TP(i+d, t-d, d)) & \quad \text{otherwise}
  \end{array} \right.\]\\
