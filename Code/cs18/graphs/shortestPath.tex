\textbf{Reachable} \\

\begin{algorithmic}
\tt{

	\Require a DAG $(V, E)$ and a source node s
	\Ensure a $reachable$ array of booleans that stores whether or not each $v \in V$ is reachable from $s$.
    \Function{reachable}{$V, E, s$}
	\State reachable $\leftarrow$ new array[size of $V$]
	\For{v $\in$ $[V^*(0), V(s))$}
		\State $reachable[v] \leftarrow$ false
    \EndFor
    \State $reachable[s] \leftarrow$ true
    \For{v $\in$ $(V^*(s), V($size of $V-1))$}
    	\For{\{$u|(u,v) \in E\}$}
			\State $reachable[v] \leftarrow reachable[parent[v]]$
        \EndFor
    \EndFor
\EndFunction
}

\textbf{Number of Paths} \\

$NP_s$ denotes a function that gives the longest paths from a source node s. The summation in o/w case is the sum of the function NP applied to all the parent nodes of the inputted node. This is all the nodes u such that there as an edge starting at u and ending at v, the argument passed in. 



\[ NP_s(v) = \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{l l}
    1 & \quad \text{if $v = s$}\\
    0 & \quad \text{if $\neg reachable_s(v)$}\\
    \sum_{u|(u,v)\in E} NP_s(u)& \quad \text{o/w}
  \end{array} \right.\]\\
