Langmod

All my code is part of the langmod package.

executables reside in the directory above the code.

The Counter class contains:
	A few hashmaps which:
		store mappings from words in the corpus to Integer encodings and back
		store unigram counts
		store bigram counts
	Methods which count unigrams and bigrams
	A class definition Bi for bigrams

The LanguageModel anonymous class contains:
	an instance of a Counter
	an implemented method for doing a golden line search
	an implemented method for finding the negative log probability of a document
	an implemented method for counting the fraction of sentences correctly identified in goodbad
	an abstract method for finding theta of the model
	an abstract method for finding the log probability of a single line of a file

The Unigram class implements LanguageModel

The Bigram class implements LanguageModel
